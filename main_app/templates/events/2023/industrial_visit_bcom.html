The visit was a vital part of the academic curriculum, helping students experience the actual functioning of the corporate world.

        During the visit, students explored operational processes such as production, supply chain management, inventory control, and human resource practices. Industry professionals interacted with the students, explaining how departments work in unison to achieve organizational goals.
        <br><br>
        The visit also gave insights into real-time accounting practices, financial documentation, GST implementation, and the use of ERP software in managing business transactions. Students witnessed firsthand how marketing strategies are applied in live environments.
        <br><br>
        This experience not only enhanced students' understanding of business operations but also motivated them to think innovatively about entrepreneurship and business leadership. The practical exposure encouraged active participation, question-asking, and collaborative learning.

        Overall, the industrial visit proved to be a great success in shaping students' future perspectives, making them more confident and industry-ready as they continue their journey through commerce education at Aggarwal College.
