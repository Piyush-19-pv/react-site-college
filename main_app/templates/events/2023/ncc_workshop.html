        Aggarwal College successfully organized an informative and engaging NCC Workshop aimed at fostering discipline, leadership, and patriotism among students. The event brought together cadets and aspirants from various streams to understand the core values and training modules under the National Cadet Corps.
        <br><br>
        The workshop began with an introduction to NCC's objectives and its history, followed by physical training sessions, drill demonstrations, and leadership-building activities. NCC officers shared valuable insights on the structure of NCC, its ranks, and the responsibilities of cadets in civic and national duties.
        <br><br>
        An interactive Q&A session allowed students to clarify their doubts about the enrollment process, certification advantages, and opportunities for national camps, Republic Day parades, and defense services.
        <br><br>
        The highlight of the event was the live demonstration of rescue and first aid techniques, which showed the role of NCC cadets during emergencies and disaster management. Motivational speeches inspired students to embrace discipline, punctuality, and service to the nation as their guiding values.
        <br><br>
        The workshop concluded with a pledge ceremony, where students vowed to uphold the NCC motto ‚ÄúUnity and Discipline.‚Äù The event left a strong impact on the attendees and encouraged many to join the NCC and contribute actively to the nation-building process.
