      <p class="text-justify mb-6">
        Aggarwal College recently conducted a Letter Writing Activity aimed at enhancing students’ writing, communication, and language skills. This initiative was designed not only to strengthen academic writing but also to develop emotional expression and clarity of thought through the medium of letters.
        <br><br>
        Students were encouraged to write formal, informal, and official letters on given topics such as “Thank You Letter to a Teacher,” “Letter to Municipal Corporation,” “Job Application,” and “Letter to a Friend.” This provided them the opportunity to practice different tones and formats based on purpose and audience.
        <br><br>
        The event also served as a platform to revisit the traditional value of handwritten letters in an age dominated by digital communication. Participants enthusiastically wrote letters using correct structure, salutations, and closing formats.
        <br><br>
        The activity helped students build confidence in expressing themselves in written form and refined their grammar, sentence formation, and vocabulary. Some selected letters were appreciated for creativity and impact.
        <br><br>
        Through this event, Aggarwal College reiterated its commitment to fostering all-round personality development and effective communication skills among its students.
