        The lecture explored key themes in Vedic literature, classical poetry, and Sanskrit grammar. The importance of Sanskrit in understanding the roots of Indian culture, philosophy, and linguistics was emphasized throughout the discussion.
        <br><br>
        Students were introduced to the application of Sanskrit in modern academic research, computational linguistics, and yoga studies. The event provided valuable insights into how the language serves as a gateway to India's intellectual heritage and spiritual traditions.
