      <p class="text-justify mb-6">
        Aggarwal College observed Environment Day through a collaborative program organized by the NSS unit. The event aimed to raise awareness about environmental protection and encourage students to adopt eco-friendly habits. The celebration began with a tree plantation drive where students planted various saplings across the college campus. This initiative symbolized the importance of greenery and a cleaner future.
        <br><br>
        After the plantation, students participated in different awareness activities like poster-making, slogan writing, and essay competitions. The themes focused on nature conservation, reducing plastic use, and sustainable living. Students used creative expressions to convey strong environmental messages.
        <br><br>
        A short skit performed by NSS volunteers highlighted the daily damage caused by pollution and careless waste disposal. It reminded the audience how small changes in daily habits can bring a big impact on the planet.
        <br><br>
        Many students took an eco-pledge to reduce plastic, save water, and keep their surroundings clean. They also signed a digital wall with their environmental commitments. The enthusiasm of the participants showed their dedication towards building a greener society.
        <br><br>
        The program concluded with a group photo of all volunteers holding handmade placards that displayed environmental slogans. This collective effort inspired all attendees to take small but meaningful steps to protect our Earth.
