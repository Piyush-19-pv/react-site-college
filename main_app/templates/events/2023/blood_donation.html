        Blood donation is not just a noble act, but a life-saving gesture that creates a real difference in the lives of patients in need.
        Aggarwal College, renowned for its dedication to social and humanitarian causes, organized a successful blood donation camp under the NSS unit on campus.
        The event was held in collaboration with a reputed blood bank and saw enthusiastic participation from students, faculty, and staff members.
        <br><br>
        The core purpose behind this event was to raise awareness about the importance of donating blood regularly and its significance in emergencies such as surgeries, accidents, and critical illnesses like thalassemia or cancer.
        The camp began with an inauguration by the Principal of Aggarwal College, who expressed his pride in the students and emphasized the role of youth in community welfare.
        The venue was decorated with posters and informative displays explaining the benefits of blood donation and dispelling myths around it.
        <br><br>
        More than 150 students registered as voluntary donors, with the entire process supervised by a certified medical team. Safety and hygiene were maintained to the highest standards, ensuring a comfortable and secure experience for all donors.
        Post-donation refreshments and certificates of appreciation were distributed to recognize their contribution.
        <br><br>
        Various awareness speeches were also delivered by doctors and NSS volunteers. They spoke about the blood replenishment cycle, eligibility criteria for donors, and the need to develop a habit of donating blood every 3â€“4 months.
        The audience listened attentively and interacted with the experts during an open Q&A session.
        <br><br>
        The event also featured a storytelling session where real-life recipients of donated blood shared how timely donation had saved their lives. These stories touched hearts and left a lasting impact on all attendees.
        <br><br>
        Aggarwal College plans to conduct more such camps every semester and will soon launch a "College Blood Donor Club" to maintain a registry of regular donors.
        This initiative aims to respond quickly to emergencies and also guide new students toward the spirit of donation and selfless service.
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, the Blood Donation Camp was more than just a college eventâ€”it was a life-changing experience for many.
        It not only collected over 100 units of blood but also instilled compassion and civic responsibility in students.
        Aggarwal College once again proved its commitment to community development and social awareness through this successful event.
