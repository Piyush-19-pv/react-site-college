      <p class="text-justify mb-6">
        Aggarwal College recently organized an Industry Visit for students to gain hands-on exposure to real-world corporate and industrial operations. The initiative was aimed at providing experiential learning and practical insight into how industries function on a daily basis.
        <br><br>
        The students visited a reputed manufacturing facility where they observed production lines, automation systems, logistics coordination, and waste management processes. The industry experts shared insights into current market trends, operational challenges, and the role of technology in streamlining business workflows.
        <br><br>
        The visit also included a detailed session on corporate ethics, safety protocols, human resource planning, and customer relationship management. Students were able to relate their classroom learnings with actual industry practices, bridging the gap between theory and application.
        <br><br>
        The interaction with department heads and professionals encouraged students to ask questions, take notes, and understand how departments collaborate in achieving organizational goals. Many students showed great interest in understanding the supply chain, finance management, and digital marketing aspects.
        <br><br>
        The event concluded with a feedback session where students shared their learning experience and expressed interest in more such educational visits. The college reiterated its commitment to providing holistic education through real-world exposure and industry interaction.
