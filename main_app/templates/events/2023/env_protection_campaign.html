      <p class="text-justify mb-6">
        Aggarwal College successfully organized an Environment Protection Campaign to raise awareness among students and the community about preserving natural resources. The aim of this campaign was to educate youth on the importance of protecting the environment through daily actions.
        <br><br>
        The campaign started with a cleanliness drive in the nearby public areas. NSS volunteers and students actively participated by collecting plastic waste, cleaning streets, and encouraging citizens to avoid littering. Posters were put up around the campus and neighborhood with strong environmental messages.
        <br><br>
        Students created banners and eco-friendly slogans such as "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" and "Protect Nature, Protect Future". These were displayed throughout the college premises to spread the message visually.
        <br><br>
        Awareness sessions were held to discuss topics like climate change, water conservation, and the harmful effects of single-use plastics. The discussions helped students understand how everyday choices impact the planet.
        <br><br>
        One of the highlights was a ‚ÄúGreen Oath‚Äù taken by all participants to use eco-friendly alternatives in daily life, reduce plastic usage, save electricity, and plant more trees. The participants also planted several saplings as part of the ongoing green initiative.
        <br><br>
        The event ended with a group photo and a walkathon inside the campus with handmade placards encouraging eco-conscious living. Through this campaign, students were reminded that even small steps can lead to big environmental changes.
