        **World Red Cross Day** was celebrated with immense enthusiasm at Aggarwal College to honor the humanitarian efforts and selfless service of Red Cross volunteers across the globe. The event aimed to instill values of compassion, service, and global citizenship among students.

        The celebration began with a formal inauguration where the principal highlighted the significance of the Red Cross Movement and the role it plays in disaster relief, medical aid, and humanitarian outreach. The event was attended by faculty, NSS volunteers, and YRC unit members.

        A key highlight of the day was a guest talk by a certified Red Cross trainer who shared inspiring stories of fieldwork and discussed the importance of emergency response skills, first aid training, and blood donation. Students were deeply engaged and asked several thoughtful questions.
        <br><br>
        An awareness rally was organized within the college premises with placards promoting themes such as ‚ÄúEvery Life Matters‚Äù, ‚ÄúBe a Lifesaver‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDonate Blood, Save Lives.‚Äù NSS and YRC students actively participated while maintaining discipline and enthusiasm.
        <br><br>
        Various competitions including poster-making, essay writing, and street plays were held to highlight the humanitarian goals of the Red Cross. Winning students were appreciated with certificates and mementos.
        <br><br>
        The event concluded with a vote of thanks and the release of a pledge to continue spreading awareness about humanitarian aid and voluntary service. The college reaffirmed its commitment to contribute to society not just through education but also through impactful community service.
