    <div class="content">
      The **Women Safety Program** conducted at Aggarwal College Ballabgarh was a major initiative aimed at empowering female students with awareness, self-confidence, and preventive skills. The program brought together expert speakers from law enforcement, healthcare, psychology, and legal aid to offer a holistic view of safety and women's rights.
      <br><br>
      One of the key highlights was a live self-defense session by trained professionals where students practiced real-world techniques to tackle potential threats. Sessions also covered online safety, mental health, harassment laws, and emergency response systems available in Haryana and across India.
      <br><br>
      Several real-life case studies and awareness videos were shown to educate students on how to avoid risky situations and how to act assertively. The interactive Q&A allowed students to share their concerns openly in a judgment-free environment.
      <br><br>
      The program also emphasized the importance of societal support and urged both male and female participants to be allies in creating safer campuses and communities. Officials from the Women’s Cell and Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) were present to guide students on complaint procedures and available support systems.
      <br><br>
      The principal praised the initiative and highlighted the college's ongoing commitment to gender equality, respect, and dignity. Students were encouraged to step forward and report any form of abuse or discomfort without hesitation.
      <br><br>
      The event concluded with a pledge where all attendees vowed to stand against injustice, support one another, and raise awareness about women's safety beyond the campus. It was not just a program—it became a movement of empowerment and action.
