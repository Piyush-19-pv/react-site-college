    <div class="content">
      Aggarwal College Ballabgarh, in collaboration with a team of certified dental professionals, conducted a free Dental Health Checkup Camp for students and staff. The initiative was aimed at spreading awareness about oral hygiene and early detection of dental issues.
      <br><br>
      The event witnessed participation from over 300 individuals, who underwent screening for common dental conditions such as cavities, gum inflammation, plaque build-up, and tooth alignment problems. Students were also educated about the importance of brushing techniques, use of dental floss, and maintaining a balanced diet to prevent tooth decay.
      <br><br>
      Dentists provided personalized consultations and shared tips on how to identify symptoms of oral issues early. Free dental kits were distributed, which included a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a tongue cleaner to promote daily hygiene habits.
      <br><br>
      Special sessions were organized where students were shown visuals and videos on the long-term effects of poor dental hygiene. The college also took this opportunity to spread awareness about the adverse effects of tobacco, pan masala, and sugary drinks.
      <br><br>
      The Principal commended the health team and emphasized that such preventive healthcare events help in promoting a culture of wellness among youth. The camp was a great success and reflected the collegeâ€™s commitment to the overall well-being of its academic community.
