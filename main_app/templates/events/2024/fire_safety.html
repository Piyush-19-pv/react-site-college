        The session was conducted by certified fire safety officers from the Haryana Fire Department. It began with a presentation on different types of fire hazards that could arise in academic and residential environments. Real-life examples, visuals, and case studies were used to engage the audience.

        Practical demonstrations included the proper usage of fire extinguishers, identifying escape routes, understanding fire alarm systems, and executing safe evacuation procedures. Staff members actively participated in hands-on drills, learning how to handle emergencies with calm and clarity.

        The session emphasized the importance of regularly checking electrical equipment, storing flammable materials responsibly, and maintaining clear exits in case of fire. A Q&A segment helped resolve doubts, making it an interactive and impactful experience.
